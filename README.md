# VBA
This is a sample macro that I would use for my job at BEBR. This macro would open each excel file within a given folder, edit it so that it was in the correct legible format for ArcGIS, save it, close it and open another excel file to repeat the same process. This allowed us to reformat 7,000+ datasets instantaneously.
